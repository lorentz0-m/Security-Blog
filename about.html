				<h1>About me</h1>
				<p>
					Hey there! My name is Lorentzo and I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering Undergrad.
					In my free time I like doing web development, and learning as much as I can about infosec
					and technology in general! Lorentz0-m happens to be my developer nickname over on
					<a href="https://github.com/lorentz0-m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>.

				<h1>What is this blog for?</h1>
				<p>
					I'm making this blog mainly for two reasons. First of all, I want to be sure that I know
					the things I'm supposed to know. Teaching something always reinforces your understanding on the
					material. That's why I encourage myself to explain and document my solutions, so I can refine
					my thinking process and have something to look back to. The second reason is as important as
					the first one, and it is about giving back to the community. I've learned a great deal from
					reading the write-ups and articles of others. Sharing back the knowledge along the way is
					in a form a small contribution.
				</p>

				<h1>How to reach out</h1>

					contact me at lmousampelliou@tutamail.com
