			<p>A setuid binary happens to be inside our home directory</p>

			<pre>
				<code>
					bandit19@bandit:~$ ls
					bandit20-do
					bandit19@bandit:~$ file bandit20-do
					bandit20-do: setuid ELF 32-bit LSB executable ---snip---
				</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				Our task is to execute the binary without arguments first, so we can find a way to use
				it, and obtain the password for the next level afterwards. Without any arguments we get:
			</p>

			<pre>
				<code>
					bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do
					Run a command as another user.
					Example: ./bandit20-do id
					bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do id
					uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19) euid=11020(bandit20) groups=11019(bandit19)
					bandit19@bandit:~$ id
					uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19) groups=11019(bandit19)
				</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				The output tells us that if we append a command as a command-line argument to the binary,
				that command will be run as another user. We can distinguish which user it refers to if
				we run the id command <i>with</i> the binary and without it. In the first case, we can see that
				we have an effective user ID (euID) set to bandit20, which verifies that we will be acting
				as bandit20 when using the binary (the name of the file is "bandit20-do" afterall). This
				is very convenient in our situation! We know that each user has read access to the password
				file of his own level. So we can use bandit20-do to get the password of level 20 like so:
			</p>

			<pre>
				<code>
					bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
					0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO
				</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				And there we go! To make things more clear as to why this worked; the reason the binary
				is a setuid file is because bandit20-do has the set user ID (or SUID) special permission
				enabled, as you can see:
			</p>

			<pre>
				<code>
					bandit19@bandit:~$ ls -lh bandit20-do
					-rwsr-x---     1  bandit20  bandit19   15K    &lt;date&gt; &lt;time&gt; bandit20-do
					(permissions)     (owner)   (group)   (size)                (file name)
				</code>
			</pre>

			<div class="notes-and-tips">
				<strong>note:</strong> the sequence of characters represents the permissions of: the owner of the file
				(rws), the group (r-x) and everybody else (---). Where r=read, w=write, x=execute and
				s=the SUID bit. A dash means the permission isn't granted.
			</div>

			<p>
				Basically, the SUID bit indicates that any user can execute the file with the permissions
				of the owner but those permissions don't extend beyond the use of that file. Here the
				owner of the file is bandit20, that's why we can execute the file as that user.
			</p>

			<div class="notes-and-tips">
				<strong>note:</strong> the fact that the SUID bit is lowercase ("s") indicates that the owner of the file
				(bandit20) has execute permissions, otherwise it would be uppercase ("S") and we wouldn't
				be able to execute the file.
