			<p>The password for the next level appears to be somewhere under the inhere directory:</p>

			<pre>
				<code>
					bandit5@bandit:~$ ls inhere
					maybehere00 maybehere03 maybehere06 maybehere09 maybehere12 maybehere15 maybehere18
					maybehere01 maybehere04 maybehere07 maybehere10 maybehere13 maybehere16 maybehere19
					maybehere02 maybehere05 maybehere08 maybehere11 maybehere14 maybehere17
				</code>
			</pre>

			<div class="explanation">
				We know that the properties of the file we want are:
				<ul>
					<li>1033 bytes in size</li>
					<li>not executable</li>
					<li>human-readable</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<p>
				So we will use them as conditions for the find command, which searches through a
				directory tree recursively and has multiple search options available. Let's try
				to only use the first condition:
			</p>

			<pre>
				<code>
					bandit5@bandit:~$ find inhere/ -type f -size 1033c
					inhere/maybehere07/.file2
					bandit5@bandit:~$ cat inhere/maybehere07/.file2
					P4L4vucdmLnm8I7Vl7jG1ApGSfjYKqJU
				</code>
			</pre>

			<div class="explanation">
				Explanation of the command:
				<ul>
					<li>with inhere/ we specify our search to start from the inhere directory</li>
					<li>-type f refers only to files and excludes directories</li>
					<li>-size 1033c specifies the file size to be exactly 1033 bytes</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<p>
				Turns out only one condition was enough! However if we wanted to search for
				non executable files that are human-readable as well we would do:
			</p>

			<pre>
				<code>
					bandit5@bandit:~$ find inhere/ -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec strings {} +
					P4L4vucdmLnm8I7Vl7jG1ApGSfjYKqJU
				</code>
			</pre>

			<div class="explanation">
				Explanation of the command:
				<ul>
					<li>! -executable uses the NOT (!) operator to reverse the effect of the -executable
					option, which matches files that are executable for the user running the command</li>
					<li>-exec strings {} + executes the strings command on each item that comes up,
					filtering out the non human-readable characters, the brackets are a placeholder
					and the plus sign is the command terminator, for more details reference the find
					manual page</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<p>
				Last but not least, since file size happens to be our only concern here, we could
				find our way around a solution by using the du command, which is used to estimate
				file space usage, by executing the following:
			</p>

			<pre>
				<code>
					bandit5@bandit:~$ du -ab inhere/ | grep "1033"
					1033	inhere/maybehere07/.file2
				</code>
			</pre>

			<div class="explanation">
				Explanation of the command:

				<ul>
					<li>-ab is a combination of the -a flag, which <em>includes</em> files in the storage report,
					and the -b switch that is used to get bytes in the output</li>
					<li>inhere/ indicates the directory we want to search</li>
					<li>the | symbol is called a pipe, as it "pipes" the output of one command to another</li>
					<li>in this case we are receiving the input with the grep command, which filters
					out the results that dont include the string "1033", meaning 1033 bytes in our context</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
