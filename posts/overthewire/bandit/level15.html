				In this level we have to submit the current password on localhost again. However, this time
				we have to connect over port 30001 and use SSL encryption.
			</p>

			<p>
				SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. It is a security technology used for establishing
				an encrypted link between a server and a client. The command we're going to use for
				it is called openssl. It supports various cryptography tools including s_client, which
				implements a simple client for us to connect to a remote host via SSL.
			</p>

			<p>The syntax is as follows. However, at first glance the command isn't working as intented.</p>
			
			<pre>
				<code>
					bandit15@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit15 | openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001
					---snip--- (connection data)
					read R BLOCK
					DONE
				</code>
			</pre>

			<div class="explanation">
				Explanation of the command:
				<ul>
					<li><code>-connect host:port</code>, this time we separate our host and port number with
						a colon, in contrast to the ssh and netcat commands</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<p>
				This is because by default, after a connection is established with an SSL server, s_client
				enters interactive mode, which will display any received data from the server and send any
				key presses back. Since we didn't input any keypresses the end of the "file" was reached and
				the connection closed down. To go around this problem we can use the <code>-ign_eof</code>
				option, which shuts down the connection only when the end of the file is reached in the input,
				in our case the password of the current level. We can further add the <code>-quiet</code>
				switch that implements <code>-ign_eof</code> but summarises the output as well.
			</p>
			
			<pre>
				<code>
					bandit15@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit15 | openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:30001
					Can't use SSL_get_servername
					depth=0 CN = localhost
					--snip---
					verify return:1
					Correct!

			</pre>

			<p>And just like that the server returned the password for the next challenge!</p>
