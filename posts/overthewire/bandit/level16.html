				This level is similar to the previous one, but we are asked to find the port we will have
				to connect to ourselves. The available ports range from 31000 all the way up to 32000, we
				don't know which of them are open and which of the open ports speak SSL.
			</p>

			<p>
				To figure out our target port we will have to scan over all available options. A utility
				that can do that for us (and many more) is nmap, which stands for "network mapper" and it
				is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing.
			</p>

			<p>
				To specify service detection (also called version detection) in our scan we have to include
				the <code>-sV</code> flag. However, since service detection requires multiple probes to be run per
				open port, it slows down the scan speed significantly. To overcome this we will use the
				<code>--version-intensity</code> option, which can limit the number of probes sent to each open port.
				Intensity equal to one means light and nine tries all probes. Applying the previous we get:
			</p>

			<pre>
				<code>
					bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -sV --version-intensity 1 -p 31000-32000 localhost
					Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at <date> <time> <time zone>
					Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
					Host is up (0.00010s latency).
					Not shown: 996 closed ports
					PORT      STATE SERVICE     VERSION
					31046/tcp open  echo
					31518/tcp open  ssl/echo
					31691/tcp open  echo
					31790/tcp open  ssl/unknown
					31960/tcp open  echo
					---snip---
				</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				The results of our scan indicate that only two open ports speak SSL. 31518 runs the echo
				service which we aren't interested in, but port 31790 runs an unknown service which might
				just be what we are looking for.
			</p>

			<pre>
				<code>
					bandit16@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit16 | openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:31790
					---snip---
					Correct!
					-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
					MIIEogIBAAKCAQEAvmOkuifmMg6HL2YPIOjon6iWfbp7c3jx34YkYWqUH57SUdyJ
					---snip---
					vBgsyi/sN3RqRBcGU40fOoZyfAMT8s1m/uYv52O6IgeuZ/ujbjY=
					-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
				</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				Turns out we got a private ssh key instead! Create a temporary file with mktemp and save
				the key there so you can use it to connect to the next level. Afterwards you can read the
				password from /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17 if you want to take a note of it.

				<strong>tip:</strong> with ctrl+shift+c you can copy text from the terminal and with ctrl+shift+v paste
				it in a command-line editor like vim or nano.
